Fetching all alliance airlines details from API


Requirements

Please use the online platform CodeSandbox to share your work:
codesandbox.io

General Requirements

● The application must at least match the provided mock ups. You may feel free to
experiment beyond that, but make sure that all specifications provided are
followed.

● The application must behave as a single page application (do not reload the
document for any of the behavior).


Functionality Requirements

● The page must behave responsively to accommodate smaller window widths so
that the tiles in each row always fit in the window without being cut off. A mock
up is provided showing an example of the grid within a smaller window.

● Each Airline tile should display the airline name and logo. On hover, more
information about the airline should be displayed (Alliance name, phone number,
& website). The Alaska Airlines & Ukraine International Airlines tiles in the mocks
illustrate the expected display on hover.

● The Alliance filter above the tiles should filter the list of Airlines to only show
Airlines matching the enabled filters if any are selected. If none are selected, the
entire list should be shown

Resources

● You may use any online resource or documentation to complete this assignment,
as long as you write the code yourself.

● You may use any open source libraries to complete this task (e.g. Angular, React,
jQuery, etc), but React is preferred as it is the library we use internally.

● You're free to use CSS preprocessors (e.g. LESS, SASS, etc)

● Airline information is available via a jsonp API:

● The alliance field in the JSON objects returned from the API should be used
for the Alliance filter shown in the mock ups. The alliance codes map to the
following values:
ST = “Sky Team”
OW = “Oneworld”
SA = “Star Alliance


Mockups

● An SVG is provided for the logo.

● In the folder are 1 full size mock of the app at a normal desktop screen width and
1 example mock of the app at a smaller screen width to demonstrate
responsiveness.

● There are 2 spec images with annotations on top of the original mocks to provide
information on spacing, color, font-size, etc.

● For all tiles, both by default and on hover, assume the logo & text are always
vertically and horizontally centered within the tile. Also the dimensions of each
tile should not change.
